# LPNAgg

SageMath code for **parameter optimization and performance evaluation** of the scheme presented in  
**“Code-Based Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Aggregation.”**

This repository provides tools to explore communication costs and parameter trade-offs of LPN-based secure aggregation, including CRT parameter selection under different security and collusion settings.
This is **not** a full cryptographic implementation.  

**Requirements:** SageMath (≥ 9.0)
